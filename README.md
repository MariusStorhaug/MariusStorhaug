# About

I am a Senior Consultant in Microsoft Consulting Services, focusing on Azure Cloud and DevOps practices. I have been with Microsoft
 since April 2020. Since joining Microsoft I have been in 4 projects with CSP/MSP partners, where 3 have been CCoE type projects.
 Before joining Microsoft I was an Azure Architect in Sopra Steria's internal CCoE.

I live just south of Oslo, Norway in a town called Ski, with my wife, Sigrid, and 2 :cat: (Milo and Lulu). On my spare time I work
on some pet development projects, and tend to spend some time gaming. Game of choice, WoW.
